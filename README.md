# UVDHDS_transcriptomics
Part of the **UVDHDS** project investigating the Effects of **UV** exposition on **D**ifferentiation of **H**uman **D**ermal **S**tem cells in melanomagenesis.

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis pipeline, processed data, and figure scripts for the first publication associated with the *UVDHDS* project.  
The study investigates how UV irradiation affects the differentiation of human dermal stem cells (DSCs) and their potential role in melanoma initiation.

This repository specifically covers **bulk RNA-seq transcriptomic profiling** of donor-matched DSCs and melanocytes under various UVB exposure conditions.
