# UVDHDS_transcriptomics
Part of the **UVDHDS** project investigating the Effects of **UV** exposition on **D**ifferentiation of **H**uman **D**ermal **S**tem cells in melanomagenesis.

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis pipeline, processed data, and figure scripts for the first publication associated with the *UVDHDS* project. 
The study describes for the first time transcriptomic (mRNA, lncRNA, miRNA) differences between dermal stem cells (DSCs) and their melanocyte progeny. This transcriptomic profiling is the foundation for further investigations focussing differentiation process itself as well as UV induced changes. 

This repository specifically covers **bulk RNA-seq transcriptomic profiling** of donor-matched DSCs and melanocytes to establish a transcriptomic "baseline".

## Project context
The **UVDHDS** project (*"Effects of UV exposition on differentiation of human dermal stem cells in melanomagenesis"*) is part of the molecular cell biology program at the  
**Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology (LMZ), Elbe Klinikum Buxtehude, Germany.**

### Planned publications
- **UVDHDS_transcriptomics:** Bulk RNA-seq profiling of dermal stem cells compared to their melanocyte progeny
- **UVDHDS_UVresponse:** Cellular and transcriptional dynamics after (repeated) UV irradiation  
- **UVDHDS_scRNAseq:** Single-cell RNA-seq tracing of DSC differentiation trajectories
