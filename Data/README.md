  KEGG pathway gene set file for human TGF-beta signaling, used for targeted/pathway-specific enrichment analysis of transcriptional data.

- **REACTOME_SIGNALING_BY_TGF_BETA_RECEPTOR_COMPLEX.v2025.1.Hs**  
  Reactome pathway gene set file for human TGF-beta receptor complex signaling, used as above.

- **IPA_canonical_pathways.xlsx**  
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Qiagen) results table containing scores, statistics, and pathway assignments for canonical signaling pathways.

- **IPA_upstream_regulators.xlsx**  
  IPA results table with predicted upstream regulators and associated statistical metrics.

## Notes

- All count matrices use official gene symbols or miRNA names as row names; see associated metadata for column/sample matching.
- Metadata files are provided in CSV for accessibility and link samples to raw/processed data.
- The `.rds` files allow for rapid re-loading/replication of the objects used in downstream R analyses as described in the `/R` folder.
- KEGG/Reactome gene set files may be included in downstream analyses or Supplementary Material depending on manuscript decisions regarding pathway focus.
- IPA output files are directly exported from the IPA GUI and used in scripts in `/R/IPA.R` for further analysis/figure generation.
- All files are data outputs only—processing and generation details/scripts are found in `/Processing` and `/R`.
